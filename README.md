# MRI Alzheimerâ€™s Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying MRI brain scans to detect Alzheimer's disease using deep learning models. We employ **ResNet50**, **InceptionV3** and **MobileNetV2** to achieve high classification accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of MRI scans labeled for different stages of Alzheimer's disease.

## Models & Performance
We trained and evaluated two pre-trained deep learning models, **ResNet50**, **InceptionV3** and **MobileNetV2**, for Alzheimer's classification. The results are as follows:

| Model       | Accuracy (%) |
|------------|-------------|
| ResNet50   | **99.99**   |
| InceptionV3 | **99.80**  |
| MobileNetV2 | **98.00**  |
